## Functional Programming Concepts

1. **What is functional programming?** According to wikipedia, it is a programming paradigm -- a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs -- that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?** If it returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred to as deterministic), it is a pure function.

3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?** Deterministic behavior, no side effects, referential transparency, easy to test, memoization, parallel execution, easier debugging, functional composition, and concurrency and parallelism.

4. **What is immutability?** When an object or data structure cannot be modified after it is created.

5. **What is Referential transparency?** It describes a property of functions.
