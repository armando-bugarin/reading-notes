## How to use Forms in React

1. **What is a ‘Controlled Component’?** It is a form that is controlled by the state, which allows you to manage the form's state (initial state, updating state).

2. **Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.** Update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them. This can provide real-time feedback, and it will also prevent the user from having to re-enter their responses if they make a mistake.

3. **How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?** We can use the event.target.value to target what the user is entering.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. **Why would we use a ternary operator?** It is used for conditional rendering.

2. **Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**

**if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}**

condition ? true : false;
