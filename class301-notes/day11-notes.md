2. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?** Structured data with a predefined schema is a good fit for an SQL database.

3. **Give a real world example.** Employee information in a company, where each employee's data is organized into rows and columns with predefined data types.

4. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?** Unstructured or semi-structured data is a good fit for a NoSQL database.

5. **Give a real world example.** Social media comments or user-generated content, where each entry can have varying attributes without a strict schema.

6. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?** NoSQL databases are generally a better fit for hierarchical data storage.

7. **Which type of database is best for scalability?** NoSQL databases are typically better for horizontal scalability, especially in distributed environments.

## sql vs nosql

1. **What does SQL stand for?** SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

2. **What is a relational database?** A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns, and establishes relationships between the tables.

3. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?** Relational databases work with a table-based structure.

4. **What is a ‘schema’?** A schema is a blueprint or structure that defines the organization of data in a database, including tables, fields, and relationships.

5. **What is a NoSQL database?**  NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that can store and handle unstructured or semi-structured data, offering more flexibility than traditional SQL databases.

6. **How does it work?** NoSQL databases work by using various data models such as document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores, without adhering to a strict schema.

7. **What is inside of a MongoDB database?** MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, and these documents are organized into collections.

8. **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.** MongoDB is generally more flexible because it does not require a predefined schema, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures.

9. **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?** NoSQL databases may lack the strong consistency and transaction support provided by traditional SQL databases, making them less suitable for certain transaction-intensive applications. Additionally, community support may be limited compared to SQL databases.
