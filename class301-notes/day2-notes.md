## React Lifestyle

1. **Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?** Render happens first.

2. **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?** The first thing to happen is the constructor method.

3. **Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount`, `render`, `constructor`, `componentWillUnmount`, `React Updates`** constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, and componentWillUnmount.

4. **What does `componentDidMount` do?** It immediately invokes the method after the component is mounted. It's used to perform actions that interact with the DOM.

## React State vs Props

1. **What types of things can you pass in the props?** You can pass counter components, data values, functions, arrays, and objects.

2. **What is the big difference between props and state?** Props you pass into a component and you change outside the component, and state is handled inside the component.

3. **When do we re-render our application?** We re-render when there are changes in the props or state.

4. **What are some examples of things that we could store in state?** You can store data that changes over time in state. Data that can be re-rendered. Examples can be a counter, a form, input element, and anything with user input.
