## React - Docs - Thinking in React

1. **What is the `single responsibility` principle and how does it apply to components?** It means a component should only do one thing. If it grows, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

2. **What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?** It means a model without any interactivity.

3. **Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?** You need to add components that reuse other components and pass data using props

4. **What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?** Does it change over time? Is it specific to a particular instance or component? Is it used to derive other data?

5. **How can you identify where state needs to live?** You can identify by Granularity, Reuse, or Performance.

## Higher-Order Function

1. **What is a “higher-order function”?** Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

2. **Explore the `greaterThan` function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?** It takes two arguments and returns a boolean value indicating where one is greater than the other.

3. **Explain how either `map` or `reduce` operates, with regards to higher-order functions.** `map` takes an array and a function as arguments and returns a new array. `reduce` builds a value by taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value.
