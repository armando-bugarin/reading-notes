# The Coder's Computer

One of the important tools of a developer is a text editor. A text editor allows you to write and manage text. These can either be downloaded and installed on your computer or accessed online. There are many out there and it comes down to personal preference many times on which one to use. Features to look for in a text editor are code completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes, and ability to choose healthy selection of extensions available. 

Then there is different software called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). An IDE is more of an all-in-one software package. In addition to managing text, they are able to perform other functions like sending emails and many more capabilities. An example of an IDE is Microsoft Outlook. In comparison, a text editor is all about just editing text.
