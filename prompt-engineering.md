## Prep: AI and Prompt Engineering

**As a former real estate agent, I asked Open AI "What is the purpose of a home inspection when you buy a home?" The prompt generated by OpenAI is as follows:**

The purpose of a home inspection when buying a home is to assess the condition of the property and identify any issues or potential problems. Home inspections are a critical part of the home-buying process and serve several key purposes:

Evaluate the Property's Condition: A home inspection provides an unbiased and professional assessment of the property's overall condition, including its structural integrity, systems (plumbing, electrical, HVAC), and major components.

Identify Defects and Safety Concerns: Inspectors look for defects, safety hazards, and code violations that may need attention. This can include issues like faulty wiring, plumbing leaks, or structural damage.

Estimate Repair and Maintenance Costs: The inspection report often includes estimates for necessary repairs and maintenance, helping you understand the potential costs and allowing you to make informed decisions about the purchase.

Negotiation Tool: The inspection report can be used as a negotiation tool. If significant issues are found, you can ask the seller to make repairs, provide credits, or reduce the sale price to account for the necessary work.

Peace of Mind: A thorough inspection can provide peace of mind for the buyer. It helps you understand the current condition of the property and any potential concerns, allowing you to make an informed decision about the purchase.

Future Planning: The inspection report can also help you plan for future maintenance and repairs. It provides a roadmap for addressing issues over time, which can be valuable for long-term homeownership.

Legal Protection: In some cases, a home inspection can provide legal protection. If the inspector fails to identify a significant issue that later becomes a problem, you may have recourse against the inspector.

It's essential to hire a qualified and experienced home inspector to ensure a thorough and unbiased evaluation of the property. While home inspections are not typically required by law, they are highly recommended for homebuyers to avoid unexpected issues and make well-informed decisions about their prospective investment.
