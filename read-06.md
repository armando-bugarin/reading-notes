# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

Javascript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. Whereas HTML is focused on the structure, and CSS is focused on the design, JavaScript is the language that adds interactivity to the website. 

Variables are the containers that store value. Four different ways variables can be declared are: using `var`, using `let`, using `const`, and automatically. 

In JavaScript, there are 3 data types. One of them is strings, which is a sequence of text. Another is numbers, which is just numbers. And another is boolean, which is a true or false value.
