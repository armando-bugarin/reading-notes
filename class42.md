# Ethics in the workplace

I read the article "The code I'm still ashamed of," by Bill Sourour. It discusses the importance of ethics in coding and how developers must always keep that in mind, no matter the requirements. Sourour use to work for a marketing firm with many of its clients being large pharmaceutical companies. He was involved in programming a website that targeted women, specifically teenage girls. This was unethical and he knew it, and unfortunately one of the patients who had been taken the drug from the website he built had killed herself. He reminds developers to always be mindful of their code, and remember that we are the last line of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices.

# Ethics in Technology

I read the article "The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars," by Peter Nowak. This discussed the ethics of the future of self-driving cars. Some reason for concern is that it is hard to fully trust self-driving cars since they are not conscious. So the ability of a self-driving car to make a morale decision in the event of an emergency is scrutinized. Proponents do point to many benefits of self-driving cars, such as less traffic congestion, ability for driver to get tasks done in car, and give people the ability to cut down on expenses and not need to own a car.
