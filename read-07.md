# Programming with JavaScript

Control flow is the order script is executed. It is run from the first line to the last line. This can change when conditionals and loops cause the structure to change control flow. 

In JavaScript, a block of code designed to perform a task is called a function. A function is executed when something invokes (calls) it. The function will stop executing when it reaches a `return` statement. Functions are useful because they help reuse code. 

There are operators in Javascript that assign a value to a variable. Some operators are assignment, addition, multiplying, and more.
