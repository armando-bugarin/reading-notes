# Operators and Loops

Assignment operators assign a value to the left operand based on the value of the right operand. The syntax used is one equal sign (`=`). It looks like `data=value`. There can also be compound assignment operators which can be added to the left operand. For example, a compound addition operator looks like: `x+=f()`.

A comparison operator is a little different compared to an assignment operator. It compares its operands and returns a logical value based on if the comparison is true.

Loops are a way to do something repeatedly.
