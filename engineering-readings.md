# Prep: Engineering Readings

1. **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?** One thing I can bring is my experience working with clients in my past career as a real estate agent. I gained experience in marketing, propsecting, handling objections, emotional intelligence, and guiding clients throughout the whole buying process. I was a trusted advisor to clients who relied on me to help them buy a home. Hopefully that previous experience working with clients will help me in my future career in tech.

2. **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?** 3 things to help get "un-stuck" is to debug, reasses, and research. Debug is to find the problem. Reassess is to see if the problem is still there. Research is to find the solution.
