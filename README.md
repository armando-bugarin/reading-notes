### Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and skill is not inherited, but can be learned by anyone. This requires focus, disclipline, perserverance, and consistent studying and/or practice on the subject matter. Your potential should not be limited to fixed mindset beliefs. Anything can be achieved with the right mentality.

Consistency is key!

1. Learning takes time, you may not understand somethng right away and that is okay. Keep practicing and you will continue to improve.
2. Failure is part of the learning process. Failure is going to happen, you just need to use it as a learning experience instead of getting down. Learn from what you did wrong and correct it for the future.
3. Consistency is key to learning. The more consistent effort you put into studying and practicing, the better you will get at something. Consistent habbits will due great things for you.
