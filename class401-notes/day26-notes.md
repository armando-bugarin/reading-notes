1. **What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application**

Model: Represents the data structure and database schema of your application. It defines the data models and how they interact with the database.

View: Handles the presentation logic. It receives input from the user, interacts with the model to fetch data, and then renders the appropriate template to display the final output.

Template: Defines the structure of the final output, typically in HTML format. It contains placeholders for dynamic data that will be filled in by the view.

Controller (in Django, it's handled by the framework): Manages the flow of data between the model and the view. In Django, this is implicitly handled by the framework itself.

2. **Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.**

Model: Represents the data structure and interacts with the database. It defines how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated.

Template: Defines the presentation of the data. It contains placeholders for dynamic content that will be filled in by the view.

View: Handles the business logic and user interaction. It receives input from the user, interacts with the model to fetch or update data, and then renders the appropriate template for display.

URL Dispatcher: Maps URLs to the appropriate views, defining the structure of the web application's URLs.

Middleware: Processes requests and responses globally before they reach the view or after they leave the view.

In the typical web request-response cycle, a user makes a request, which is intercepted by the URL dispatcher. The dispatcher maps the URL to the corresponding view. The view interacts with the model to retrieve or update data, processes it, and then renders the template. The template, combined with the processed data, generates the final HTML response sent back to the user.

3. **What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?**

Purpose of Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes for building designs directly in your markup. It aims to give you flexibility and control over styling by providing a large set of small, single-purpose utility classes that you can compose to create your designs.

Differences from Bootstrap CSS:

Philosophy: Bootstrap is an opinionated framework with pre-designed components, while Tailwind provides utility classes for building custom designs.

Customization: Bootstrap is more opinionated and comes with a set design, making it easier to use out of the box. Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing developers to create unique designs without overriding default styles.

File Size: Tailwind tends to result in smaller file sizes since you only include the utility classes you need, whereas Bootstrap comes with a larger set of pre-built components that may increase the file size.

Learning Curve: Tailwind has a steeper learning curve as you need to become familiar with the utility classes. Bootstrap, being more structured, is generally easier for beginners.

Flexibility: Tailwind gives developers more control over styling details, making it suitable for projects with specific design requirements. Bootstrap is more suitable for rapid development with a consistent look and feel.
