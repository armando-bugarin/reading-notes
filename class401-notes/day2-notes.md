1. **What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?** Write Tests First: Before writing the actual code, write test cases that define the desired behavior of the code.
Write the Minimum Code to Pass Tests: Write the simplest code to make the tests pass. This keeps the codebase minimal and focused.
Refactor Code: Once the tests pass, refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability while ensuring that the tests continue to pass.
Repeat the Cycle: Continue this cycle of writing tests, writing code, and refactoring until the desired functionality is implemented.

2. **Explain the purpose of the `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?** This statement checks whether the Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module. A use case can be Script Execution: Code under this block is executed only when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module. This allows the script to be both a standalone program and a reusable module.

3. **Describe the concept of recursion in Python.** Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in its own definition.

4. **What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.** Module is a Python script containing Python definitions, functions, and statements. A single file with a .py extension. Imported using the import statement. Package is a collection of Python modules organized in a directory hierarchy. Contains an __init__.py file to indicate that the directory should be treated as a package. Can have subpackages. Imported using the import statement with dot notation.
