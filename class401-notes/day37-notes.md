1. **In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?**

ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduced several key features to JavaScript, three of which are:

Arrow Functions:

Benefit: They provide a concise syntax for writing functions, especially useful for short and one-liner functions, reducing the verbosity of traditional function expressions.

Template Literals:

Benefit: Improved string handling, allowing multi-line strings and embedded expressions, making it easier to write and manipulate strings in JavaScript.
Destructuring Assignment:

Benefit: Simplifies the process of extracting values from arrays or objects, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

2. **After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?**

Utility classes in Tailwind CSS are small, single-purpose classes that directly apply styling to elements. The purpose is to enable rapid and consistent styling without writing custom CSS.

Example:

`<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">This is a styled element</div>`

3. **Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.**

Next.js offers several advantages:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

Advantage: Faster initial page loads and improved SEO since the server sends pre-rendered HTML to the client.

Automatic Code Splitting:

Advantage: Optimizes performance by loading only the required JavaScript for a particular page, reducing the initial bundle size.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

Advantage: Allows developers to see changes in real-time without manual page refresh, speeding up the development process.

Comparison with Traditional Client-Side Rendering (CSR):

Next.js SSR is more efficient for SEO and initial page loads compared to CSR, where the client-side JavaScript is responsible for rendering. SSR provides a better user experience by delivering pre-rendered content from the server, while CSR relies on JavaScript execution on the client-side, which can result in slower initial loads and potential SEO challenges.
