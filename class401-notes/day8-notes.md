1. **What is the basic syntax of Python list comprehension, and how does it differ from using a for loop to create a list? Provide an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers.**

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

expression: The operation performed on each item.

item: The variable representing each element in the iterable.

iterable: The iterable (e.g., list, range) you are iterating over.

condition (optional): An optional filter for items.

2. **What is a decorator in Python?**

In Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows you to extend or modify the behavior of callable objects (functions or methods) without changing their actual code. Decorators are typically used to wrap another function or method.

3. **Explain the concept of decorators in Python. How do they work, and what are some common use cases for them? Provide an example of a simple decorator function from the reading.**

Decorators work by taking a function, modifying or extending its behavior, and returning a new function. They are commonly used for tasks like logging, timing, access control, etc.
