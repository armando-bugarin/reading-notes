1. **Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?**

Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables. The purpose of linear regression in the context of machine learning and data analysis is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of independent variables. It is commonly used for tasks like predicting sales, house prices, or any other continuous numerical outcome.

2. **Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.**

To implement a linear regression model using Python's Scikit Learn library, you typically follow these steps: import libraries, load and prepare data, create and train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the model.

3. **What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?**

The purpose of splitting the dataset into training and testing sets is to assess the model's performance on unseen data. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is kept separate to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. This helps to detect overfitting – a situation where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data. The evaluation metrics calculated on the test set provide insights into how the model is expected to perform on real-world data.
