1. **How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?**

The random module in Python is used for generating random numbers. To make selections from a list, you can use the random.choice() function.
Common functions in the random module:

random.random(): Returns a random floating-point number in the range [0.0, 1.0).

random.randint(a, b): Returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive).

random.shuffle(sequence): Shuffles the elements of a sequence randomly.

random.choice(sequence): Returns a randomly selected element from the given sequence.

2. **In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?**

Risk analysis is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing potential risks in a software project. The key steps involved include:\

Risk Identification: Identify potential risks that could impact the project.

Risk Assessment: Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each identified risk.

Risk Prioritization: Prioritize risks based on their severity and potential impact.

Risk Mitigation: Develop strategies to mitigate or manage high-priority risks.

Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor and reassess risks throughout the project.

3. **What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?**

Test coverage is a metric that measures the extent to which the source code of a program has been tested. It indicates the percentage of code lines or branches covered by tests.

Importance: Higher test coverage increases the likelihood of identifying defects. However, it can be misleading if it doesn't consider the quality of tests. Full coverage doesn't guarantee thorough testing.

4. **What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.**

Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound or worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. It provides an asymptotic analysis of the algorithm's performance.

Example of O(n) time complexity: Searching for a specific item in an unordered list. In this case, you may need to iterate through the list sequentially until you find the desired item, resulting in linear time complexity.
