1. **What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?**

***Key Features of Jupyter Lab:***

Integrated Environment: Jupyter Lab is an integrated development environment (IDE) that combines the features of a notebook, text editor, terminal, and file browser.

Tabbed Interface: Jupyter Lab offers a tabbed interface, allowing users to work on multiple documents (notebooks, scripts, etc.) simultaneously.

Rich Text Support: It supports rich text elements, such as HTML, LaTeX, and Markdown, providing more formatting options.

Interactive Widgets: Jupyter Lab allows the integration of interactive widgets for enhanced data exploration and visualization.

File Management: Users can manage files and directories directly within the interface.

***Differences from Jupyter Notebook:***

Jupyter Lab provides a more comprehensive environment, whereas Jupyter Notebook focuses mainly on interactive notebooks.

Jupyter Lab has a modular design, allowing users to arrange and customize the interface to suit their needs.

Jupyter Lab includes a file browser and a text editor, which are not present in the traditional Jupyter Notebook.

2. **What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?**

***Main Functionalities:***

Arrays: NumPy provides a powerful N-dimensional array object that can be used for various data manipulation tasks.

Mathematical Functions: It includes a wide range of mathematical functions for array operations, linear algebra, statistical analysis, and more.

Broadcasting: NumPy allows operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes through broadcasting, making it convenient for element-wise operations.

Random Number Generation: It offers functions for generating random numbers, essential for simulations and statistical applications.

Indexing and Slicing: NumPy arrays support advanced indexing and slicing, making it efficient for data extraction and manipulation.

***Usefulness in Python Programming:***

NumPy is fundamental for scientific computing, providing efficient and optimized numerical operations.

It enhances the capabilities of Python for handling large datasets and performing complex mathematical computations.

Many other libraries and frameworks in the scientific Python ecosystem (such as Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn) are built on NumPy.

3. **Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.**

Basic Structure and Properties:

NumPy arrays are homogeneous and can contain elements of the same data type.

They are multi-dimensional, allowing the representation of matrices and tensors.

Arrays have a fixed size, and elements are accessed using zero-based indices.
