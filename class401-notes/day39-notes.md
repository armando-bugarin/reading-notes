1. **What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?**

React Context:

React Context is a feature in React that allows you to share values like props between components without explicitly passing them through each level of the component tree. It's often used for global state management, avoiding the need to pass props through intermediate components that don't need them.

Managing State and Data Sharing:

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This is particularly useful when dealing with global state or configuration settings. Instead of passing props through every level of the component tree, you can wrap your components with a Context.Provider to make the value available to all children components.

2. **Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.**

The useContext hook is a React hook that allows functional components to subscribe to React context without introducing a nesting hierarchy. It takes a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) as an argument and returns the current context value.

3. **Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.**

Purpose of Next.js:

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple deployment. It simplifies the creation of React applications by providing a set of conventions and helpers, allowing developers to focus more on building features and less on configuration.

Example from Vercel Next.js Examples:

One of the examples provided by Vercel Next.js Examples is the "with-apollo" example. It demonstrates how to integrate Next.js with Apollo Client, a popular GraphQL client. This example showcases how Next.js can be used to build a scalable web application by combining server-side rendering with the power of GraphQL for efficient data fetching and management.
