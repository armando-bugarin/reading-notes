1. **Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.**

Variable scope refers to the region in code where a variable is accessible or can be modified. In Python, there are two main types of variable scope: local and global.

Local Scope: Variables defined inside a function have local scope. They are only accessible within that function.

Global Scope: Variables defined outside any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from any part of the code.

2. **How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?**

Global Keyword: It is used to declare a variable as global within a function, making it accessible and modifiable from anywhere in the code.

Nonlocal Keyword: It is used to indicate that a variable is not local, nor global, but belongs to the nearest enclosing scope that is not global. This is often used in nested functions.

3. **In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.**

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its time or space complexity. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's resource usage. In simpler terms, it helps analyze and compare the performance of different algorithms as the input size increases.

4. **Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.**

To simulate a dice roll, you can use the random module. The probability of rolling a specific number over a large number of trials can be calculated by recording the occurrences of each outcome.
