## The Command Line

**What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.**

The command line is where a user inputs their commands in the termianl. It is also where the output of a command is displayed. The command line allows users to perform various tasks, such as navigating the file system, managing files and directories, running programs, and configuring system settings.

## Basic Navigation

**An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.**

One good I learned, which I have saw throughout this whole course but didn't know what it meant was the command PWD. PWD stands for Print Working Directory. It is a command that prints the path of the current working directory. It is useful for finding out where you are in the file system.

There are 2 paths to use, absolute and relative. Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root directory. Relative paths specify a location in relation to the current working directory.

## More About Files

**Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.**

One thing intersting was learning about file extensions. file.exe is a executable file, or program. file.txt is a plain text file. file.png, file.gif, and file.jpg or an image file. 

Spaces between words can be used, but can be tricky to navigate around. You would need to wrap quotes around the words, or use escape characters, such as (\). `ls -a` is a good to command to use, it is to display the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

## Manual Pages

**Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.**

Manual Pages are a set of pages that explain every command available in Linux. They are very helpful for learning new commands, and for remembering how to use commands. One thing I did not know, is that you are able to search for a keyword on Manual Pages. The command for this is `man -k <search term>`. One good piece of advice, is that instead of remembering everything, remember you can easily look up stuff in main pages.

## File Manipulation

**How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.**

The command to make a directory is `mkdir <directory name>`. The command to remove a directory is `rmdir <directory name>`. The command to rename a file is `mv <file name> <new file name>`. The command to copy a file is `cp <file name> <new file name>`. The command to move files is `mv <file name> <new file name>`.

The cheat sheet is a quick reference for the main points covered in this tutorial. It is a good way to remember the commands learned. The File Manipulation commands seem most useful to me.
