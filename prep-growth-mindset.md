# Prep: The Growth Mindset

Emotional Intelligence is something I am trying to improve. I try to get better in all aspects, such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Out of those, I am not the best at relationship management. I tend to be introverted and shy. This makes it difficult to network which is imporant in this career field. I also tend to struggle some while leading, but I am getting better. I have gotten a little better with networking throughout this course, such as networking more on LinkedIn, talking to my classmates more, and trying to get more involved in the community. Emotional Intelligence is a constant focus to improve, and I will continue to improve more throughout this course.
