1. **Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?** Because it can leave a key on the user's computer and read it when they return.

2. **What information should not be stored in local storage?** Sensitive information should not be stored in location storage, such as PII, user locations, and API keys.

3. **Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?** Local storage can only store strings. You can use `JSON.stringy()` and `JSON.parse()` methods to covert before storing.
