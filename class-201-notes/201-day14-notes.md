1. **What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?** Three keys that contribute to psycholigcally safe teams are conversational turn-taking, empathy, and social sensitivity.

2. **Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.** As a real estate agent, I worked for a brokerage that was rather small in size. This lead to a team feel. Every tuesday, we would meet in the office and just talk about real estate trends, obstacles some agents were facing, current listings by agents, and talk about non-real estate related topics as well to connect on a personal level. While discussing, everyone had the opportunity to speak their mind and it was a collaborative environment where everyone was willing to help someone else out if there was any problems. I didn't hang out with anyone outside the office too much, but during our meetings every week, it felt like a psycholigcally safe team environment.

3. **What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?** This can lead to higher productivity, but also help individuals feel a purpose and increase morale which is really important for workers.
