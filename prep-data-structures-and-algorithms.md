# Prep: Data Structures and Algorithms

1. **What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?** One crucial consideration when choosing a data structure for a particular problem is understanding the specific operations that need to be performed on the data and their associated time complexities. Different data structures excel at different operations, and selecting the right one can significantly impact the efficiency of your algorithm.

2. **How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?** To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, it's essential to establish a base case in the recursive function. A base case is a condition that, when met, terminates the recursion and prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely. Failing to include a base case or ensuring that the base case is reachable could lead to a stack overflow, causing the program to crash.
